# Quadratic Formula
### This progam computes the two x values of a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.

It propmpts the user for the a, b and c values. Then it computes the two values for x and return them. This program can handle complex numbers and negatives under the radical. The goal is to allow the user to get the x values of any quadratic equation without having to do the computation by hand. 

As a security measure, it will reprompt the user for a, b and c values until they are valid (i.e. they are all numbers, a != 0).
